# HoloLens Blueprints
This is the code repository for [HoloLens Blueprints](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/hololens-blueprints?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787281943), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.

## About the Book
Do you want to create stunning applications with HoloLens? Are you a developer who is fascinated with Microsoft HoloLens and its capabilities? If so, this is the book for you.

This book introduces and demystifies the HoloLens platform and shows you different ways of interaction with computers (mixed-reality).

You will start your mixed-reality journey by understanding different types of digital reality. You will learn to build your first holographic app. Also, you will understand holographic application integration possibilities within Line of Business Applications using Azure. Moving ahead, you will create Integrated Solutions using IoT with HoloLens. Gradually you'll learn how to create and deploy apps on a device. You will learn to publish application to the store; if you are an enterprise developer, you will also manage and distribute applications for enterprise-enabled or domain-joined HoloLens.

Finally, you will develop an end-to-end realistic holographic app, ranging from scenario identification to sketching, development, deployment, and, finally, production.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter04.



The code will look like the following:
```
public class LensGestureHandler : MonoBehaviour, IInputClickHandler
{
public void OnInputClicked(InputEventData eventData)
{
throw new NotImplementedException();
}
// Use this for initialization
void Start()
{
}
// Update is called once per frame
void Update()
{
}
}
```
